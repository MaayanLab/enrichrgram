I have a flask server that is running enrichment analysis and making a clustergram of the input genes and the enriched terms. I need to do the following: 

To Do 
	1. make virtual environment so that I can load it to one of the servers 
	2. clean up visualization
	3. add reorder capabilities by: pval, num of terms, etc
	

build
	sudo docker build -t first_image .

remove old images 
	sudo docker rmi [imageid]


view images 
	sudo docker images
	(look for image id and place in the docker run id)

get into container
	sudo docker ps 
	(look for the container id)
	sudo docker exec -it 62a74a5ffad3 bash

start docker server 
	sudo docker run --rm -it -p 80:80 -v /home/nick/Documents/d3_clust_proj:/app 62a74a5ffad3 bash /app/boot.sh


remove containers and images 
	sudo docker ps -a | awk '{print $1}' | xargs sudo docker rm
	sudo docker images | awk '{print $3}' | xargs sudo docker rmi


--- instructions to push to loretta
	
	I added in the code using a few ADD lines in the Dockerfile 

	
	# build image (happens quickly if things are cached)
	sudo docker build -t clustergram_flask .

	# push to dockerhub 
	sudo docker push maayanlab/clustergram_flask

	# ssh into loretta
	ssh root@10.91.53.62
